Web Infrastructure Design with a LAMP stack. where we are required to use a web server, application server, codebase and database where 
the https requested will be searched and a https response given back to user for www.foobar.com.
we used firewalls, load balancer and a monitoring tool of your choice to monitor the designed infrastructure. And to make it secure we added
a SSL certificate.
